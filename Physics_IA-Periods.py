"""
    Calculates the period of Lagrange Points (L4 and L5) of Earth-Moon system if the mass of Earth were to increase.
    The distance from Earth to the L points (r), is assumed constant. In reality, the resulting period(s) would
    be lower than the values found here; the r value would decrease due to an increasing gravitational pull, caused 
    by an increasing primary body mass.
    Based on t = 2*Ï€*sqrt(r^3/GM) formula.
